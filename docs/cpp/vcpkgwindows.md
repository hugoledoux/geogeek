# Windows: vcpkg with Visual Studio & CLion

!!! warning
    
    We recommend you use [Chocolatey to install packages](../computer/packagemanager.md), or [WSL](../linux/wsl.md).

    vcpkg is an alternative, but it is more complex and difficult to setup.


## Why an alternative solution?

Using thrid-party libraries can sometimes not be very straightforward on Windows, actually using [WSL on Windows](./wslclion.md) is indeed a convenient way. 
However, there are some disadvantages:

* **WSL will incrementally occupy system disk space**.
    
    **WSL** is installed on **C drive** by default, there are quite a lot blogs on the internet to show how to move your **WSL** to another drive, but usually it is not recommended to avoid possible issues.
    
* **running project in WSL can be slow**

    It depends on the situation, but practically speaking, the more you use **WSL**, the slower the compilation speed and the running speed may be as the size of the occupied space increases.
    
    Another concern is about **gcc/g++** compiler, in some situations, it compiles slower than **MSVC(cl.exe)** on windows(for example in our practice **MSVC** compiles **CGAL** faster)
    
* **separately isolated file system**

    The file system of **WSL** is separated from **windows**, which means only if you have opened **WSL** from windows, the files in it can be accessed. This is sometimes not convenient.

## Using vcpkg and visual studio on windows

What is **vcpkg**? To be in short, vcpkg is a free **C/C++ package manager** for acquiring and managing libraries. Maintained by the **Microsoft C++ team** and **open source contributors**.

## install vcpkg

#### Step 1: Clone the vcpkg repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
```
Make sure you are in the directory you want the tool installed to before doing this.
#### Step 2: Run the bootstrap script to build vcpkg
```
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
#### Step 3: Install libraries for your project

While in the directory of vcpkg:

```
vcpkg install [packages to install]
```
#### Step 4: Using vcpkg with MSBuild / Visual Studio (may require elevation)
```
vcpkg integrate install
```
**Note**: **Step 4** is not necessary if you are using **CLion**.

After this, you can create a new project or open an existing one in the IDE. All installed libraries should already be discoverable by IntelliSense and usable in code without additional configuration.

For more detailed info, you can refer to [vcpkg - get started](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)

## install CGAL

```
vcpkg install cgal
```

if you want to specify 64bit version:

```
vcpkg install cgal:x64-windows
```

## install GDAL

```
vcpkg install GDAL
```

**Notes:**

It would be more convenient if you use **Windows Powershell**. In **Powershell**, you can install libraries via:

```
PS path\to\vcpkg> .\vcpkg install [package name]
```

All in all, using **WSL** can make you familiar with the linux environment in advance - if you will use linux for development in the future.
While if you are using **windows** platform (as far as I know most of first year students are using it since the Geomatics suggests so), it might be a good idea
to use **vcpkg** and **MSVC**. 

And with regard to **vcpkg**, there is one very comprehensive video:

[install vcpkg step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7SdgK7Y510)

It explains how you download and build **vcpkg** and use it **step by step**.

## Using vcpkg with Visual Studio

Since we've integrated **vcpkg** with **MSBuild / Visual Studio**, you need to do **nothing** if you are using [Visual Studio C++ project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/creating-and-managing-visual-cpp-projects?view=msvc-160). In your header / source files, you can for example just type:
```cpp
#include <CGAL/Polyhedron_3.h>
```
and the header file should be automatically detected and included.

if you are using [CMake project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-160), you need to add corresponding scripts in your **CMakeLists.txt** file, for example, if you want to include **CGAL**:
```cmake
find_package(CGAL)
if (CGAL_FOUND)
	include(${CGAL_USE_FILE})
	message(STATUS "CGAL found")
	message(STATUS "CGAL VERSION" " " ${CGAL_VERSION})
else()
	message(SEND_ERROR "this code requires the CGAL library")
	return()
endif()
```

## Using vcpkg with CLion

**(1)** configure **C++ tool chain**: **File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Toolchains**
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72781910/198726367-3664de52-49f5-4d90-a872-c3c34404c5a4.png" height="500">

see [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html) for more details.

**Note**: About selecting architecture:

- **x86**: The compiler is the x86 version and the output target is x86.

- **amd64_x86**: The compiler is the amd64 version and the output target is x86.

- **amd64**: The compiler is the amd64 version and the output target is amd64.

- **x86_amd64**: The compiler is the x86 version and the output file is amd64.

**(2)** configure **CMake option**: **File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> CMake**
```console
DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Now you are all set to include your desired library in **CMakeLists.txt**, for example include **CGAL**:
